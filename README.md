ScrabbleBot
===========

ScrabbleBot is an ongoing project open to the community started by MehSki11zOwn. The goal is to innovate a Java bot that will play any game of Scrabble you face it with by analyzing the tiles available both in the player's hand and on the board to form the highest scoring move possible.

The current configuration of the script is made to play *Words With Friends*, a Scrabble spin-off commonly played via Facebook.

To run:
Download the compiled JAR file and run via:
java -jar Scrabble.jar <game name> <letters you have>

It is my goal that with the help of the community, the various formulas and processes in this script can be altered until we have one of the first fully-operational, self-contained, Java Scrabble bots!

Thanks to http://wordfinder.yourdictionary.com/ for allowing this program to be possible.
